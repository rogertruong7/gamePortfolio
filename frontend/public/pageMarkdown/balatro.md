A Rust-based command-line tool for calculating poker-hand scores in the Balatro Clone game. It parses a YAML description of a single round, applies poker and joker rules, and outputs the final score, with optional explanatory output.

---

## Overview

Balatro Clone is a poker-themed scoring engine that evaluates a single round of play. Players combine standard playing cards and special Jokers to maximise their score. This tool focuses solely on computing the score of one hand based on card plays, held cards, and Joker effects.

## Features

- **YAML Input**: Accepts a YAML file describing:
  - `cards_played`: list of played cards (1–5)
  - `cards_held_in_hand`: list of held cards (0–5)

- **Standard Poker Hands**: Calculates base chips and multiplier for hands such as:
  - High Card, Pair, Two Pair, Three of a Kind
  - Straight, Flush, Full House, Four of a Kind, Straight Flush
- **Extended Hands**: Supports "illegal" hands unique to Balatro:
  - Five of a Kind, Flush House, Flush Five
- **Joker Effects**: Applies special rules for Jokers (e.g., Raised Fist, Zany Joker) that modify chips or multiplier in sequence order
