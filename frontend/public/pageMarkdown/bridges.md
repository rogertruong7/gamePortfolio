Bridges is an online platform designed to connect student societies with potential corporate sponsors in a streamlined, secure environment. It offers three distinct account types—User, Sponsor and Society—each with tailored registration and verification processes to ensure authenticity: societies are confirmed via official society emails and Arc verification, while sponsors are validated using company emails and ABN checks. Super Admins oversee the platform, verifying new society registrations to prevent unauthorised sign-ups.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js with App Router
- Express.js Backend
- PostgreSQL/MongoDB
- NextAuth.js: Easy to integrate authentication with OAuth support (Google, GitHub, etc.).
- Tailwind CSS


Once registered, Sponsor and Society Admins access a comprehensive dashboard and feed where they can browse, filter and sort organisations by industry, interests, degree tags and sponsorship status. Each entity has its own profile page showcasing its vision, past and current sponsorships, testimonials and contact options. Admins can manage profile details, handle partnership requests (both general and event-specific), and assign or revoke team permissions.

Bridges features integrated chat and email tools, enabling direct messaging and formal communications within the platform, with granular controls for visibility and notification preferences. A dedicated Partnerships section tracks incoming, outgoing and active sponsorships, offering status updates and historical records. One-off events can also be created by societies or sponsors, with bespoke partnership workflows for event-based collaborations. By uniting all these capabilities, Bridges simplifies sponsorship management for both student societies and businesses, fostering transparent and efficient partnerships.
